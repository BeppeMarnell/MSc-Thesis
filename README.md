# MSc Thesis on Wildfire risk assessment using remote sensing data

Hi to whoever ends up here on this webpage. Here there is the material I used for my master thesis. You're free to use the code ad check what I have done. 
> What have I done here in a few words? I have built a machine learning model capable of assessing the risk of a wildfire over the entire globe using remote sensing data.

> The model presented here was able to predict wildfires in the US with an 80% score and a lower score in the rest of the world.

## Abstract

Assessing the risk of wildfires over the entire globe can be crucial in avoiding harm to wildlife, economy, properties and humans. This is known to be a challenging task. Here, a machine learning model is trained on a dataset composed of remote sensing data variables such as topography, vegetation and weather. The model is able to assess the risk of fire with a spatial resolution of 1000m/pixel. It achieves optimal results compared to other state-of-the-art architectures. Most of the variables in the dataset are found to be critical for the task, while few were disregarded. Particular focus has been given to collecting data across a variety of landscapes. Specifically, samples from Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe, South America and the US are included. This research shows the potential for deploying global wildfire risk assessment applications.
